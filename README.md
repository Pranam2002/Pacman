# GitHub Pacman Contributions Game 🕹️

A fun animated project where Pacman eats your GitHub contributions on a grid. Inspired by the classic retro arcade game and the GitHub contribution graph.

This project visualizes your GitHub contribution graph as a grid and animates a Pacman character moving through it, gobbling up the cells where you made commits. Once it finishes, the grid resets and starts again — forever hungry.
